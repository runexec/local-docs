I think the current fix is to add this JS declaration before you
import your cljs generated js file. IIRC, this is only needed when
building without advanced optimizations.

<script type="text/javascript">
var CLOSURE_NO_DEPS = true;
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/myapp.js"></script>
